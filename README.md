If you are unable to connect directly to WhatsApp, a proxy can be used as a gateway between you and our servers. To help yourself or others re-establish connection to WhatsApp, you can set up a proxy server.

If you already have a proxy to use, you can connect it to WhatsApp by following the steps in this [article](https://faq.whatsapp.com/520504143274092).

## What you'll need

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (enable Docker on startup if your host system allows)
2. [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (optional)

## Setting up your proxy

### 1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your system
### 2. Install Docker compose

For Linux users, if your [version of Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) doesn't come pre-installed with Docker compose, you can install a one-off version (For Linux).

```bash
# Download the pkg
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/bin/docker-compose
# Enable execution of the script
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/docker-compose
```
### 3. Build the proxy host container

Build the proxy host container with

```bash
docker build /path/to/git/repo/ -t whatsapp_proxy:1.0
```

The container will be compiled and tagged as `whatsapp_proxy:1.0` for easy reference

## Running the proxy

### Manually execute the container

You can manually execute the Docker container with the following `docker` command

```bash
docker run -it -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 5222:5222 -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 -p 8222:8222 -p 8199:8199 whatsapp_proxy:1.0
```

### Automate the container lifecycle with Docker compose

Docker Compose is an automated tool to run multi-container deployments, but it also helps automate the command-line arguments necessary to run a single container. It is a YAML definition file that denotes all the settings to start up and run the container. It also has restart strategies in the event the container crashes or self-restarts. Docker Compose helps manage your container setup and necessary port forwards without user interaction. We recommend utilizing Docker Compose because you usually donâ€™t want to manually run the container outside of testing scenarios.

We provide a sample [docker-compose.yml](./proxy/ops/docker-compose.yml) file for you which defines a standard deployment of the proxy container.

Once Docker compose is installed, you can test your specific configuration by running Docker compose interactively with:

```bash
docker compose -f /path/to/this/repo/docker-compose.yml up
```

This will allow you to see the output from the build + container hosting process and check that everything is set up correctly.

When you are ready to run the container as a service, do\*:

```bash
docker compose -f /path/to/this/repo/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

*\*Note the `-d` flag which means "daemonize" and run as a service.*

To stop the container you can similarly do:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Automate host reboots with Docker compose

Once you have Docker compose set up, you can also automate the deployment for host reboots by utilizing a `systemd` service (if your hosting environment supports it).

We provide a sample [`docker_boot.service`](./proxy/ops/docker_boot.service) service definition for you which you should customize to your own environment.

To install and setup the `systemd` service\*:

```bash
# Copy the service definition to systemd folder
cp -v docker_boot.service /etc/systemd/system/
# Enable starting the service on startup
systemctl enable docker_boot.service
# Start the service (will docker compose up the container)
systemctl start docker_boot.service
# Check container status with
docker ps
```

*\*Make sure to update the path to your specific `docker-compose.yml` file in the service definition `docker_boot.service`*

## Kubernetes deployment

If you would like to configure your proxy using Kubernetes, or run the Docker runtime through Kubernetes, please see our [Helm chart README](./charts/README.md)

# An Overview of the WhatsApp Proxy Architecture

Depending on the scenario in which you utilize your proxy, the proxy container exposes multiple ports. The basic ports may include:

1. 80: Standard web traffic (HTTP)
2. 443: Standard web traffic, encrypted (HTTPS)
3. 5222: Jabber protocol traffic (WhatsApp default)

There are also ports configured which accept incoming [proxy headers](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/use-the-proxy-protocol-to-preserve-a-clients-ip-address/) (version 1 or 2)
on connections. If you have a network load balancer you can preserve the client IP address if you want.

1. 8080: Standard web traffic (HTTP) with PROXY protocol expected
2. 8443: Standard web traffic, encrypted (HTTPS) with PROXY protocol expected
3. 8222: Jabber protocol traffic (WhatsApp default) with PROXY protocol expected

Additionally the container exposes a statistics port on `:8199` which can be connected to directly with `http://<host-ip>:8199` which you can use to monitor
HAProxy statistics.

## Certificate generation for SSL encrypted ports

Ports 443 and 8443 are protected by a self-signed encryption certificate generated at container start time. There are some custom options should you wish to tweak the settings of the generated certificates

* `SSL_DNS` comma seperate list of alternative hostnames, no default
* `SSL_IP` comma seperate list of alternative IPs, no default

They can be set with commands like

```bash
docker build . --build-arg SSL_DNS=test.example.com
```
